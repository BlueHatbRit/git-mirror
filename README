This package contains some scripts to help setup a GitHub mirror.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1- build-repo-list
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script generates a list of repositories by making an authenticated api call
to GitHub. It will only pull down repos owned by the authenticated user.

Example: ./build-repo-list \
						-t <github personal access token>

This will create a repos.txt file with a list of all the ssh url's of the users
public repos.

You can add the -p flag to create private-repos.txt file with all the users
private repos instead.

Example: ./build-repo-list \
	-p \
	-t <github personal access token>

Note: If you re-run this it will overwrite the original file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2- mirror-repos
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script takes a file with a list of ssh url's for git repos and clones or
updates a mirror of each repo in the file.

Example: ./mirror-repos \
	-f repos.txt \
	-d /srv/cgit/public-repos

The above will clone a mirror of all the repos in repos.txt under the
/srv/cgit/public-repos directory. If a repo already exists it will be updated.

Note: If the file list is changed to remove a repo, this script will not update
said repo. It does not keep track of repos outside of the given list and so will
not delete them if they are removed from the given.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3- cron example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These scripts can be used independantly or together for many purposes, I use
them with cron to keep some cgit mirrors up to date.

Example:

# Update the list of public repos to mirror, outputting repos.txt
45 0 * * * ./build-repo-list -t <gh pat>

# Clone or update a mirror from the list generated above
0 1 * * * ./mirror-repos -f repos.txt /srv/cgit/public-repos
